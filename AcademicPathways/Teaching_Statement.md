## What are your goals for student learning in your discipline?
- I would like students to know how to assign a mathematical model to a physical phenomenon.  I want them to be able to identify the givens and finds.  I want them to then learn the mathematical structures (usually differential equations and linear alegra) that allow them to get to the various finds from the various givens.
- I would like students to have a feeling of self-efficacy, that they can be independent thinkers in their fields, and that they can use what they learn to serve or persuade.
- I would like students to gain a sense of agency in building their own toolboxes to investigate their own questions.
- Discussion collaboration
- Group matching -- optimize confidence in coding, math, physics knowledge, science writing
    - Generation effect
- Narrative; why instead of dates and names. "Why did we read this"?
- Motivate approach -- with effort, they can learn any and all material
- Time on tasks -- mastery of learning
- Reverse outline
- Unlearning

## What type of teaching methods do you use to help students move toward those goals?
- I would give real-world examples and demonstrate the basic numerical analysis tools to compute real values.
- I would break down the hidden curriculum or academic work at the introductory level.
