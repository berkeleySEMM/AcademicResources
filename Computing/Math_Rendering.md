# Math Rendering

- To make math render without errors in packages such as matplotlib,
you may have to install latex in several ways. For example:
    1. pip install latex
    2. sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
    3. sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
    4. sudo apt install cm-super
    5. sudo apt install dvipng
